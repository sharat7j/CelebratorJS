This is a variation of snowflake program.Instead of snowflakes drifting down in your browser,it is showered with roses.
There is a message and a button used to stop the shower.
This is a geeky way of expressing your love to a special person on valentine's day. :)
How to use it?
type:
javascript:var%20s%20=%20document.createElement('script');s.type='text/javascript';document.body.appendChild(s);
s.src='https://raw.github.com/sharat7j/xyz/master/pro001.js';void(0);
in your chrome/firefox address bar. See the magic.
(Note: in chrome when u copy paste the code,the 'javascript:' at the beginning does not get copied at the beginning.
u need to type it specifically.no such problem in firefox)
